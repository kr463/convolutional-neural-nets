# CS 4670 Project
This project explores convolutional neural networks in the context of image classification using Pytorch. We built and trained a basline model, implemented data augmentation techniques, built our own model to improve upon the baseline, and generated adversarial examples to explore potential potential shortcomings of the CNN model.
